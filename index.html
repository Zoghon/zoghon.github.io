    In a world where superpowers are a regular thing to be born with, nearly half of the population with each unique powers and skills. While most decide to use their powers for good and to help themselves and others, some didn't agree and decide to use the powers their given to danger others.
    That's when in 1985 when superheroes were introduced, while being a brilliant idea at first and made everything better for the people. Suicide rates and villain attacks started raising slowly through out the decades, By the 2000s the rate was higher than ever.
    Around the 2000s multiple medication had been developed and made for powered people to control themselves, they were mostly taken by powered-people with childhood trauma and mental disorders. Some reject the medication due to the side effects (loss of appetite, insomnia, dizziness, headaches, weight gain, exc)
    The Government decided to make Mental Asylums for the mentally-ill powered people. Superheroes are more of a common now and police are more of a rare now, Hero Academies introduced with over 200 students already. Hero Academies around the 2010s had to install metal detectors and extra monitoring of the students after multiple tragedies and even suicides at the academies.
    <br> 
    <br>What happens when a boys dream to become a Hero no matter what it takes gets immediately crushed? Born in Philadelphia. Jonathon Hart and his best friends decide to go on a ridiculous and gory journey after an incident with the Superheroes, to find out and uncover the dark secrets behind them and the Hero Academies.
