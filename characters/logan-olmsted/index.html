<br>Power: Loud Waves (Can shoot loud acoustic waves towards a target, requires a instrument)
<br>
<br>Born in California. Later moving to New York with his parents at the age of 12, Logan is a well-talented person when it comes to playing the bass guitar. Logan inspires to become a professional guitarist and preform his music and sing to millions, but when his parents found out about his unique power. They instead applied him for N.Y. Hero Academy, which at first he thought sounded cool. But after a year or two at the shcool, slowly realizes there's no music class and usually self-teaches himself during break.
