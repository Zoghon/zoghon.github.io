            <br>Born: Nov 8 2004
<br>Age: 15
<br>Height: 6"3
<br>
<br>Power: Metal Skin (Activated by biting his teeth together, downside is that it’s harder to move)
<br>
<br>Born in Dublin, Ireland. Later moved to New York with his parents at the age of 6, Luke O’Neill is a lazy and chilled out person. He used to play for a football team for his local school in New York, until he had an injury that made him stay out of a few games. He later decided to apply for All Hero High to try to discover more about his power and use it for more.
