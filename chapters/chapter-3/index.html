                </p>
                <br>The gang is seen currently parked not far from the academy, they start to prepare for the mission as Nara finishes up with Jon.
                <br>
                <br>Nara: "Holy shit, I'm gooood."
                <br>Jon: "How bad is it?" Jon stares at Edan while Nara glimmers at her work. Ronny tries his best to not fucking laugh.
                <br>Edan: "You look like you ask for butthole pics"
                <br>Jon: "Oh jesus christ…"
                <br>Nara: "What are you two on about? I think he looks great."
                <br>

                </div>
                <br>Ronny starts bursting out screaming, instantly falling down crying of laughter, whilst Edan manages to contain his laughter. But his face clearly shows that it was very difficult.
                <br>
                <br>Edan: "I mean, If that's what you're into then I guess so."
                <br>Nara: "Oh shut up! Anyways, Jon. You remember the plan?"
                <br>Jon: "Uhhh yeah, go in, walk around, get to know people and scope out the place."
                <br>Nara: "Good, cause you'll be doing that for the whole week."
                <br>Jon: "Huh?!"
                <br>Nara: "You're not just scoping out the academy. You're actually IN the academy."
                <br>Jon: "What you mean by that?"
                <br>Nara: "Somehow my brother was able to apply you to the academy, and you actually got accepted."
                <br>Jon: "Huh?! How?! and why?"
                <br>Nara: "Don't know how, and most likely the fact that he was in the basement with us the whole time yesterdayl."
                <br>Jon: "Oh, okay. Wait, hold on. Wait wait wait wait. Does this mean I'm officially in N.Y.?"
                <br>Nara: "Yes, and no." Jons face went from glee, to concern.
                <br>Nara: "You ARE in N.Y., but it's under a fake identity that he made up. Sooo you kinda have to pretend your someone else, why do you think I made you put on a disguise?"
                <br>Jon: "Oh yeahh, well I mean. That sounds kinda cool as shit not gonna lie, like being undercover while doing what I always wanted to do. Easy, so what's my new identity?"
                <br>Nara: "Here it is." Nara hands over Jon his new id Rok made for him.
                <div class="chapterimage">

                <br>Jon: “Huh..”
                <br>Nara: “What?” Nara responds with a concerned look.
                <br>Jon: “It’s just weird, ya know. Actually seeing my face on the ID.”
                <br>Nara: “Yeah, I’m just surprised how he managed to do it.”
                <br>Edan: “Oh yeah how the hell did he even manage to make one?”
                <br>Jon: “Most likely hes been doing this for awhile.”
                <br>Ronny: “Wait, what if he secretly like, works for like, the deep web!”
                <br>Jon: “Like a supervillain?”
                <br>Ronny: “LIKE A SUPERVILLAIN!!!”
                <br>Jon: “Yo, Nara is your brother a villain?!”
                <br>
                <br>Edan and Nara both stare at each other in disappointment.
                <br>
                <br>Edan: “The fuck are you two even saying?!”
                <br>Nara: “I’m just going to forget I even heard that.” Nara gets up as she throws her makeup aside.
                <br>Jon: “What?? That would be cool as shi-” 
                <br>Nara: “Get going.”
                <br>Jon: “Wha-” <b>BAM</b>
                <br>Nara: “Now.”
                <br>Jon: “But-”
                <br>Nara: “NOOOWWW.”
                <br>Jon: “OKAY OKAY JESUS FUCKING RELAX, You bitch!”
                
                <br>Jon gets up as he walks towards the door with his school bag. 
                <br>
                <br>Nara: “Oh yeah and one last very important thing!”
                <br>Jon: “What.”
                <br>Nara: “Don’t blow your cover, or break character. No matter what.”
                <br>Jon: “Relax, I am the fuckin masta when it comes to this shit baby.”
                <br>Nara: “Oh really?”
                <br>Jon: “Yeaahhhh-”
                <br>
                <br>Nara being the bitch she is, kicks him from the back out of the RV as she slams the door behind him.

                <br>
                <br>Jonathon struggles to get up from the hard kick but barely manages to get up, sweeping the dirt of his jeans. He grabs his bag of the floor and starts walking away from the RV towards the academy. As he walks up the steps to the academy, one of the students notice his scrapped face with dirt on it, they immediately rush over asking if he is feeling okay.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “Uhh yeah, why?”
                <br>
                <br>“You look hurt, here let me help!”

                <br>Meet Andy
                <br>
                <br>Andrew is a very kind soul and sometimes even shy, he usually loves to help others in need whenever he can, which makes his main goal to become a backup-hero. He doesn’t really talk much, only mainly talking when asked a question or with someone that needs assistance.
                <br>
                <br>“Andy, where are you goin- Oh, Hello!”

                <br>Meet Emily
                <br>
                <br>Emily is a very brave and sweet person, usually standing up to others, aswell as sometimes quite competitive when it comes to games and gym training. She is also talented in drawing, mostly trying to be the best in art class.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “Jesus christ hello”
                <br>Emily: “I’m sorry about him, whenever he sees someone even with a bruise anywhere he tends to come over and help them.”
                <br>Jon: “But I'm fine?”
                <br>Emily: “Even with that scar on your head?”
                <br>Jon: “What scar?”
                <br>
                <br>Andrew quickly grabs a plaster from his backpack and plasters it onto Jons forehead.
                <br>
                <br>Andrew: “Better?”
                <br>Jon: “Better? I didn't even know I had a scar”
                <br>Emily: “You didn’t notice it?”
                <br>Jon: “I didn’t even feel it.”
                <br>Emily: “Wow, that’s uhh. weird.. Anywayys who are you? I’ve never seen you before”
                <br>Jon: “Oh yeah, I'm new. This is actually my first day, so it’s gonna be quite interesting being in a new school.”
                <br>Emily: “Oh nice! Oh yeah I’m Emily by the way!” Emily quickly pulls out her hand to shake Jons hand
                <br>Jon: “Danny, Danny Mael.”
                <br>Emily: “Nice to meet you Danny, What class are you in?
                <br>Jon: “Uhmm Grade 10-B” 
                <br>Emily: “Oh! We’re 10-A! Looks like we will be seeing each other more often, oh yeah by the way this is Andrew. The weirdo medic!”
                <br>Andrew: “I-i’m not weird?”
                <br>Emily: “I was joking you dummy!” The two proceed to laugh as Jon stares around him, not long before he notices the huge school logo above the main entrance.
                <div class="chapterimage">

                </div>
                <br>Jon: “Wow..” The two quickly turn around as they see Jon staring up at the logo
                Emily: “Hey pal, you feeling alright?”
                Jon: “Yeah… It’s just so weird actually being here y'know.”
                <div class="chapterimage">

                </div>
                <br>Emily: “Well congrats I suppose! welcome, and enjoy hell!” The two later walk away into the building.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “Hell? The fuck she mean by that?”
                <br>
                <br>LUNCH TIME - 12:33PM
                <br>
                <br>Jonathon is seen sitting down in the cafeteria with his two new friends he made in 10-B, Ezequiel and Kyle. They both chat to each other about the latest films while Jon has a pale look on his face, One of them, Ezequiel sees his face all paling up.
                <br>
                <br>Ezequiel: “Hey man, are you feeling good?”
                <br>Kyle: “You look like shit.”
                <br>
                <br>Jonathan's vision starts to get blurry as his head starts to rapidly heat up.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “I gotta go, one of yous can have my lunch.”
                <br>
                <br>Jon quickly gets up and runs towards the bathroom while they both stare at each other.
                <br>
                <br>Kyle: “Hey free food.”
                <br>Ezequiel: “True that.”
                <br>
                <br>Jonathan busts through the door as he nearly falls onto the toilet, instantly vomiting into the nearest bathroom stall, while he vomits. Three more students walk in while having an conversation.
                <br>
                <br>“For the last fucking time, I’m not going to do LSD.”
                <br>“C'mon man! I promise it’s gonna be fine! The odds of a bad trip are very low. I even did my research!”
                <br>“You and Kia can take them, I don’t want to do it and that’s final. No more questions you fucking retard-”
                <br>
                <br>BLURJGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH
                <br>
                <br>“What the hell was that?”
                <br>“Just fucking great. I don’t care at this point, I need to piss”
                <br>
                <br>The student busts into the bathroom stall next to Jon and starts going number one, eventually Jonathon gets up and flushes the toilet. Jonathan has to be careful when around a crowd of people, staying around them for too long can cause nausea and make him vomit. Jonathon walks out of the bathroom stall as turns on the tap, washing off his face.
                <br>“Hey man you feeling alr-”
                <br>Jon: “Yes. I’m, I’m fine”
                <br>“It’s fine if I ask why, right? I’m not trying to intrude on your personal space.”
                <div class="chapterimage">

                <br>Jon: “It’s okay.. Just stomachs hurtin..”
                <br>Edgar: “Oh, well get well man. That shit sucks. Also, don't think we’ve met?”
                <br>Jon: “Danny.”
                <br>Edgar: “Ah, Edgar.”
                <br>Jon: “Well I'm already making a great first impression” Edgar chuckles to himself.
                <br>Edgar: “Yeah you really are!”
                <br>
                <br>A toilet is heard flushing as the bathroom stall behind him opens.
                <br>
                <br>“What the hell are you two shitheads talking about.”
                <div class="chapterimage">

                </div>
                <br>Jon, currently dizzy and not thinking straight, says the first thing that comes to his mind.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “We’re talkin about Nonya”
                <br>Seb: “Who the hell is Nonya, and who the fuck are you?”
                <br>Jon: “Nonya fuckin buisness bitccchhh!”
                <br>
                <br>Edgar tries his best not to laugh while Seb stares into Jons soul with fustraction, while Jon looks at Seb with a retarded smile. Seb instinctively walks over and grabs Jons shirt collar.
                <br>
                <br>Seb: “So you think you're fucking funny?”
                <br>Jon: “Hehe yeah.” 
                <br>
                <br>Seb: “Jesus christ, you smell like shit.”
                <br>Jon: “I know that smartass.” They both stare at each other, looking like they're about to fight.
                <br>Edgar: “I’ll umm, wait outsideee.” Edgar quickly exits the bathroom, leaving the two alone.
                <br>
                <br>Sebastian immediately lets go of Jons shirt collar after he smelled the vomit on his face and the tap.
                <br>
                <br>Seb: "Talk to me like that again, and I‘ll blow your fucking face off. Got it?" He angrily says while emitting little explosions from his palm. Jon tries his best not to break character again.
                <br>Jon: "Fuckin fine.."
                <br>Seb: "...Good."
                <br>Sebastian grabs a piece of tissue from his pocket and throws it at him.
                <br>
                <br>Seb: "Clean yourself up. You have vomit all over your face." Seb walks towards the door with his hands in his pockets.
                <br>Jon: "Thanks."
                <br>Seb stops in his tracks and turns his head sideways.
                <br>Seb: "What?"
                <br>Jon: "I saaaid Thhanks."
                <br>Seb stares at him for a solid few seconds, while Jon looks back at him being weirded out.
                <br>Seb: "...."
                <br>Jon: “What?”
                <br>
                <br>Seb soon exits the bathroom leaving with Edgar while Jon sits down next to the tap all to himself.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: "Fuckin asshole.."

                <br>Jon slowly gets up and looks at himself in the mirror, with stains of vomit on his face and his body slowing aching. He clenches his fists on the tap as he slams his fist down onto the sink, damaging his hands again. He holds in his scream of pain while gritting his teeth together, he slowly releases his fist seeing that the edges of his fingers are slowly bleeding.

                <br>While Jonathon was barely surviving school, the three others decide to go shopping for food and supplies for the basement. Whilst they look around and down the aisles, Edan and Nara are talking about her recent purchases.
                <br>
                <br>Edan: "So you bought four masks, and you want me to customize them?”
                <br>Nara: “Well first off, their balaclavas. And second off, yeah. I think they would look pretty cool if you designed them”
                <br>Edan: “Why did you even buy them in the first place?”

                <br>Edan: “Yeah, Imma admit I kinda forgot about it.”
                <br>Nara: “That’s okay, just don’t forget again”

                <br>Sounds of gunshots are heard firing throughout the shop, the customers instantly get down whilst others hide behind the shopping iles. The three quickly flick their heads at each other hoping one of them would perhaps catch an idea.
                <br>

                <br>
                <br>“The well is that sound?” one of the robbers questions, “Which one of you fucks is doing that?” The customers on the ground turn at each other in worry but also confusion.

                <br>Ronny in pure rage, activating his power. Rushes towards the robber that shot the toy car. The other robber quickly pulls up his gun to Ronny, but before they could pull the trigger. A quick blue light flicks behind them, turning around in hesitation, is meet with a punch to the face with Nara’s fist. Ronny puts his hands on the robbers neck and starts strangling them. Edan watching from the back notices him strangling the robber.
                <br>
                <br>Edan: "Hey man, Don't kill the guy!"
                <br>Ronny: "Fuck you! I'm having this one!"
                <br>
                <br>Ronny ignores Edan and continues to strangle the robber, meanwhile on the side. Nara struggles to beat up the other robber realizing she isn't very strong, she does manage to land a few punches. But the robber blocks most of her punches and starts shooting, before the bullet could collide with her she quickly teleports again. Causing the bullet instead to hit the wall. She ends up near behind the robber, with quick instinct she grabs the gun in their hand and tries taking it off them, meanwhile back to Ronny. He continues to strangle the robber whilst Edan watches from the back.
                <br>
                <br>Edan: “Fuck it...”
                <br>
                <br>Edan holds in a deep breath as he turns invisible, sneaking up to Ronny only to punch him right in the dick, causing him to drop the robber on the ground. The robber struggles to catch their breath while Ronny holds both of his hands on his crotch groaning in pain.
                <br>
                <br>Ronny: “OWWHHH WHAT THE FUCK!”
                <br>Edan: “No killing! We’re trying to do good!.”

                <br>
                <br>The two turn to their side to see Nara beating the shit out of the other robber with the handle of their gun.
                <br>
                <br>Edan: “Hey I think he’s knocked out”
                <br>

                <br>
                <br>She can’t stop, She won’t stop. She continues to bash their head, blood starts to splatter onto her hands.
                <br>
                <br>"P-lease....." The robber barley says while starting to gargle on their own blood.
                <br>
                <br>Edan: “I SAID HE'S KNOCKED OUT!” Edan rushes over to pull her away, but she instantly swings the gun close to Edans face. Edan stares in pure shock as the handle of the gun stays still next to his head, Nara’s eyes widen as she slowly comes to the realization. She quickly gets up and run out to the RV, without hesitation Ronny quickly follows whilst Edan slowly turns around looking at all the people on the floor.
                <br>
                <br>Edan: “Y-your welcome!...” He then sprints out of the shop, wondering what they just did, was heroic. Or villainous.

                <br>
                <br>Nara: "Is Ronny?-"
                <br>Jon: "Jesus fuck..."
                <br>
                <br>Edan: "Who’s gonna tell Ronny that his earbuds aren't plugged in."
                Jon starts scratching his hand rapidly as his headache gets even worse, causing him to burst out his anger from earlier. He storms towards the bedroom door and starts kicking it.
                <br>Jon: "RONNY KNOCK THAT FUCKING SHIT DOWN!"
                <br>Ronny: "Oh f-fuck! I'm sorry man relax i-i'll turn it down!" Jonathon storms back to the couch and sits down with his hands clenched.
                <br>Nara: "Are you sure you okay?"
                <br>Jon: "YES- I mean! Yes, it's just. it was just a rough day, that's all."
