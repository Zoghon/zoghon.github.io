                In 1827, the first ever powered-person was born. Lambert Grimm, Age 12. He had developed telekinesis at
                the age of 11 after an incident with his parents, After the shocking discovery of his powers. He decided
                to do talent shows for a living and show the people his many tricks with his new powers, during out his
                career in his mid 30-40s he became very desperate for lust and affection. Causing him to hook with tons
                of hookers and fans at the time, it was reported around 40-50 other women he had slept with. Almost all
                of them reported to have been pregnant, some even with twins. When Lambert had gotten the news he broke
                down and slowly realized what he had done. A few weeks later Lambert had taken his own life leaving all
                the women with the children on their own. The many children were also born powered, but not with the
                same power as Lambert. They all had their own unique powers, Levitation, X-ray Vision, Flame,
                Permeation, Mind-Reading, the list goes on and on. By the 1900’s it was reported 10% of the population
                was born powered, at first everyone was happy and well with their new powers and abilities. But since
                this is real life, nothing good lasts forever.

                The first world war had begun, many of the powered citizens were drafted and sent into the army. The
                battlefields covered in more blood and screams louder than ever before, soldiers and citizens getting
                punched through their guts and heads. Others getting crushed with telekinesis from left to right, for
                years many hid from the soldiers. But many more hid from the powered-soldiers in pure fear, some even
                had to watch their family and friends getting executed by French and British powered-soldiers. Lasering
                them causing their bodies to split in half as they attempt to scream for help, but the soldiers just
                stared and laughed. Even some children that were captured were beaten up as the others that were hiding
                had to stay quiet while they had to watch it all happen.

                After the screams faded away and the blood washed into the ground. People celebrated at first for the
                war being over, but some later cried in agony after hearing about the loss of their loved ones. 62
                million casualties, 35 million reported deceased while the remaining 27 million in critical condition,
                few years later this caused hate towards powered people. There were even protests to put the powered
                people behind bars for good or deported, half of powered people decided to move around the world. Most
                went to the United States while the others went to the United Kingdom. Many years later the population
                for powered people went up to 25%. It remained calm for a while, until a pissbaby german got declined
                for his drawings.

                When the second war began, even more powered people were selected and drafted into the war. Causing even
                more casualties, but ending the war faster. During the war, It was found that Adolf Hitler hired German
                Physicians to run experiments on powered people. One of the physicians Josef Mengele discovered that
                they could extract others powers from others and inject them into soldiers, this caused Hitler to demand
                soldiers from Schutzstaffel (SS) to raid people houses to not only find Jews, people of color, people
                with disabities, gay people and socialists. But he demanded people with powers to be taken and put
                specifically under experiments, a few months during the process. One of the subjects that originally
                applied to join the Army was found to be able to take multiple powers at once, they decided to mainly
                focus on him and once a week inject him with a new power that was donated or stolen from other people of
                power. The subject was later used as a weapon to decease and laser Jews in the camps aftering finding it
                more efficient and less time consuming. Near the end of the war the subject suffered a mental breakdown
                and started lasering anyone in their eyesight, causing 600 deaths and 183 critically injured Jews. The
                subject later flew away from the camp and escaped out of the country to never be seen again. This caused
                all the experiments all for nothing and causing Germany to lose the war.

                85 million casualties, 71 million deaths and 14 million critically injured. Most of the surviving
                soldiers of the war were powered as some of them have been discovered to have been injected with
                enhanced strength. The powered Nazis had to be executed by British and American powered soldiers, some
                even took their own lives using their powers before the Allies had the chance. The subject was still not
                found and was later given the title “Belzec” as they were officially declared the most powered person in
                the world .They were written down in the history books as one of the most wanted people in the world.
                Adolf Hitler was secretly a powered person and had the power of Manipulation (being able to control
                multiple and even being able to change their thoughts), He was later shot to death after ordering one of
                the commanders to shoot him directly in the head and then shooting themselves. In the United States of
                America everyone celebrated as fireworks were being set off and people in the streets cheering and even
                making out. Powered soldiers and jets seen flying in the sky for celebration. Everyone was happy and
                finally at peace as they all sat in their backyards grilling out some burgers as their family members
                returned home from the war. Hugging their parents and crying in joyfulness to see them again.

                Decades later the powered population is now at 47%, The government officially declared schools and jobs
                for both powered and non powered people to work together. Super High Schools and Superhero Departments,
                while more safer now for our society. Is now also more dangerous due to Supervillains. Crime rate
                raising and Budget for Super Academies and Superhero Departments now rising since 1985, reports of more
                casualties and villain attacks since 2001. But other than that, everything else seemed alright since it
                was normal.

                But for now let’s forget about all that nonsense, this story isn’t mainly about that boring stuff. This
                story is going to be about the life and adventure of our good little friend in Philadelphia who’s about
                be given birth into this shitty fucking country, Welcome to the world.
                <p></p>
                Jonathon Hart.
                <p></p>
                The doctors surround Jonathon’s mother, Rose. As one of the doctors officially present her son to her,
                “Here he is!” she shed a tear in happiness “It’s a b-boy?” she stuttered. “Yes madam! Not to be rude,
                but I think that’s kinda obvious” the doctors points down revealing the baby as everyone in the room
                stare at him in shock “That cunts bollocks are fuckin hangin!” said David, Jonathon’s Father. Rose
                laughs for abit as she tells David to be quiet, Rose slowly holds the baby in her hands as she stares at
                him in Joy.
                <p></p>
                “I’ll name you… Jonathon...”
                <p></p>
                “The only bad news is that your son is unfortunately not powered..” one of the doctors said to her “Wait
                what how-” Before she could finish her sentence. Roses twin sisters Julie and Michelle quickly knock at
                the door and open it “I’m sorry but Rose turn on the news now!” “Why?” Rose questioned “I can’t explain,
                just turn it on now!”
                One of the doctors turns on the news station as they higher up the volume. The news currently showing a
                live feed from a helicopter showcasing the near end of a fight between Captain Platinum and a top wanted
                villain in a football stadium, before the villain dies they look at the camera in the distance and it
                slowly zooms in on their face. Before they could get a good look at the villain, Captain Platinum
                quickly flies into them as they both fly out of the camera frame, a few minutes later after the
                helicopter flying around, it cuts to a different camera on the ground and a news reporter rushing inside
                of the football stadium.
                They eventually see Captain Platinum as he is seen holding the hoodie of the villain as he slowly pans
                down and sighs turning around slowly, a few more seconds of dead silence until he looks into the camera
                and smiles “He’s gone” as smiles proud and thumbs up. Everyone starts to cheer in the hospital as others
                are heard celebrating outside, but Rose just stares at the TV for a few seconds then down to her son,
                “I hope you know I will always love you no matter what.” as she smiles at him.
                <p></p>
                Few seconds later Jon farts.
