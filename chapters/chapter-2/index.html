                <br>The whole gang are currently pasted asleep in the living room, while one of them. Jon, is seen
                passed out on the fucking floor with some chips laying around him. Nara’s phone alarm goes off
                immediately frightening the shit out of everyone.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “Jesus fuck!....”
                <br>Ronny: “Why is that yOUR RINGTONE!”
                <br>Nara: “It helps me get up as fast as possib-”
                <br>
                <br>Before she could even finish her sentence, Edans alarm goes off as well. Waking up the neighbours
                dogs as they start barking.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “FOR FUCKS SAKE!”
                <br>
                <br>Ronny falls on the floor as Nara turns her alarm off and peacefully wakes up, while Edan rushes up
                and goes to the fridge to grab a breakfast bar.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “What time is it even?...”
                <br>Nara: “Half seven in the morning”
                <br>Jon: “Shit….”
                <br>
                <br>Jon slowly gets up as he stretches his hands, realizing he’s wearing nothing but underwear.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “Where the hell are my fucking clothes?"
                <br>
                <br>Ronny grabs Jon shirt thats laying on the couch
                <br>
                <br>Ronny: “Here’s your shirt, but I have no clue where you put your pants.”
                <br>Jon: “…fuck I need to piss so fucking badly.”
                <br>
                <br>Jon quickly goes into the bathroom as he puts on his shirt, shutting the door behind him.
                <br>While the others get prepared for school, little explosions are heard outside the apartment complex.
                Ronny being the closest one to the window, takes a peek out the window to see no other than Pro-Hero
                Dynomight landing down.
                <br>
                <br>Ronny: “Oh shit.”
                <br>Nara: “What?”
                <br>Ronny: “It’s fucking Dynomight.”
                <br>Nara: “Huh?! The fucks he doin here?”
                <br>Edan: “Oh shit that makes so much sense now.”
                <br>Nara: “What makes sense?”
                <br>Edan: “The gas station explosion, remember?”
                <br>
                <br>Nara and Ronny both make a shocked expression at the realization.
                <br>
                <br>Ronny: “Oh shieet, Fuck we gotta go.”
                <br>Nara: “Wait what hold on-”
                <br>Ronny: “Hey Jon piss faster! We gotta go now!”
                <br>Jon: “What?!”
                <br>Ronny: “Piss faster! We need to go now!”
                <br>Jon: "Why?! We're not in a fuckin hurry it's just school"
                <br>Ronny: "This is more than just school, just speed it up!"
                <br>Jon: "How the fuck does someone even piss faster?!"
                <br>Edan: “I usually think about boobs, that can help sometimes.”
                <br>
                <br>Nara quickly flicks her head towards Edan in pure confusion.
                <br>
                <br>Nara: “What.”
                <br>Ronny: “THINK ABOUT BIG AND BOUNCY BOOBS!”
                <br>Jon: “WHAT!?”
                <br>Ronny: “JUST DO IT! BIG BOUNCY AND SOFT BOOBS!”
                <br>Jon: “AAAAAAAAAAA”
                <br>
                <br>After a few seconds of screaming and intense pissing, Jon eventually finishes pissing as the toilet
                flushing is heard. Jon slowly pulls up his pants as he walks out of the bathroom nearly tripping on
                himself.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “That actually worked… now I'm ffeeling dizzy..”
                <br>
                <br>Intense banging is heard on the door as it startles the gang.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “W-who’s th-”
                <br>
                <br>Ronny quickly shuts Jon up by covering his mouth telling him to shut his fucking mouth.
                <br>
                <br>Ronny: “What are we going to do?”
                <br>Nara: “Hide Jon, I know what to do.”
                <br>
                <br>Ronny quickly grabs Jon and puts him back in the bathroom.
                <br>
                <br>Edan: “I keep on forgetting how strong that nigga is."
                <br>Nara: “Coming!”
                <br>
                <br>Nara walks to the door and opens the door with a smile on her face, as the Pro-Hero is seen menacing
                in front of her.
                <br>
                <br>Nara: “H-how can I help you sir?”
                <br>Dynomight: “Have you seen this man anywhere”
                <br>
                <br>Dynomight quickly pulls up a photo of Jon that was taken from surveillance footage that was
                recovered from the explosion.
                <br>
                <div class="chapterimage">

                </div>
                <br>
                <br>Nara: “Oh yeah, I saw him walking somewhere down that way on my way over here actually.”
                <br>
                <br>Nara proceeds to point towards the long apartment hallway as Dynomight sighs in exhaustion.
                <br>
                <br>Dynomight: “Did you by chance see which door he went to?”
                <br>Nara: “Unfortunately not sir, I was in a hurry.”
                <br>Dynomight: “Alright… Thank you for your cooperation.”
                <br>Nara: “Glad to help!”
                <br>Dynomight: “If you ever see this man anywhere, make sure to report it to the Hero Department as soon
                as possible.’
                <br>Nara: “Will do!”
                <br>
                <br>Dynomight proceeds to walk down the hallway as Nara closes the door.
                <br>
                <br>Edan: “Huh.”
                <br>Nara: “What?”
                <br>Edan: “Nothing, just didn’t think you could act that good.”
                <br>Nara: “It’s literally my job.”
                <br>
                <br>Jon quickly busts the door open as Ronny walks about out behind him.
                <br>
                <br>Ronny: “Dude don’t kick the fucking door.”
                <br>Jon: “Well don’t grab me like that! Anyways I have to g-go.”
                <br>Nara: “You can’t, he’s still out there”
                <br>Jon: “Who’s he? I still have no ffffucking idea what’s happening.”
                <br>Nara: “Just don’t, trust me.”
                <br>Jon: “Will ya ffuckin relax, I'm a master at sssneakingg.”
                <br>
                <br>Jon quickly walks to the front door as he slowly and quietly opens it, he pokes his head out as he
                sees Dynomight still walking down the other way knocking on each door. He eyes wide open as he slowly
                tips taps away towards the stairs and the gang stare in pure fucking confusion, after a few seconds he
                immediately falls on his face instantly alerting Dynomight.
                <br>
                <br>Ronny: “RUN!”
                <br>
                <br>The gang quickly ran for the stairs as Jon got up and legged it down the stairs.
                <br>
                <br>Dynomight: “STOP!”
                <br>
                <br>Dynomight uses his explosion ability to blow himself forwards, giving him a boost aswell as setting
                off the smoke alarm. The gang runs down the stairs and they sprint out of the apartment lobby.
                <br>
                <br>Edan: “WHERE NOW?!”
                <br>Ronny: “THE RV!”
                <br>
                <br>The gang proceed to run towards Ronny’s RV as Ronny struggles to unlock the RV door.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “HURRY THE FUCK UP!”
                <br>
                <br>Dynomight is seen blowing himself out the front door as Ronny manages to unlock the RV door.
                <br>
                <br>Ronny: “GET IN!”
                <br>
                <br>The gang quickly hop into the RV as they shut the door tight while Jon leans against the door.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “STEP ON THE FUCKING GAS.”

                <br>Ronny sits down in the front as he quickly puts the key into gear and steps on the pedal, Dynomight
                grabs onto the front door as the RV starts to drive off onto the road. Jon struggles to keep the door
                closed as Dynomight shortly blows the door open, but before Dynomight gets a chance to walk in. Nara
                quickly grabs a kitchen knife and stabs his hand, causing him to fall off the doorframe while his pinkie
                rips off his hand.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “PINKIE!”
                <br>Edan: “EW KICK IT!”
                <br>Nara: “NO, DON’T KICK IT.”
                <br>.
                <br>.
                <br>.
                <br>.
                <br>Then Jon kicked it to Edan…
                <br>
                <br>Edan: “AAAA NONONONONONO GET THAT SHIT OUT”
                <br>.
                <br>.
                <br>.
                <br> .
                <br> Then he immediately kicked it back to Nara.
                <br>
                <br> Nara: “EWH EWH EWHWHHH-THROW IT OUT!”
                <br>
                <br>As the others continue to kick the bleeding pinkie around, Ronny is seen driving while with
                earphones on. Listening to his favorite jam.
                <br>
                <br>Ronny; “Do you want a banana? Peel it down and go mm mm mm mm. Do you want a banana? This banana for
                you~”
                <br>
                <br>The others eventually stop kicking the finger around as Jon grabs a piece of cloth and grabs the
                finger with it.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “RELAX, FUCK!”
                <br>
                <br>Nara opens the RV window as Jon tries to throw the finger out the window, only to completely miss
                and throw it into a glass of water.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “Fuck.”
                <br>Nara: “HOW DID YOU MISS?!”
                <br>Jon: “IT’S HARDER THAN IT LOOKS!”
                <br>Nara: “GOD DAMMIT!”
                <br>
                <br>Nara grabs the glass pouring out the water and the pinkie out the window.
                <br>
                <br>Edan: “God…”
                <br>
                <br>After they successfully get rid of the pinkie, they lay out and relax on the floor, while Ronny
                drives the car he hears them hitting the floor and takes one of his earphones out.
                <br>
                <br>Ronny: “What happened?”
                <br>

                <br>Eddie wanders around the school hallways looking through each classroom, after abit of searching. He
                looks through the glass of the math classroom, seeing a blonde-haired fella doing his homework as well

                <br>Seb with his usual grumpy expression continues to stare down at his homework, angrily gripping his
                pencil.
                <br>
                <br>Seb: “I’m fine… It’s just this question makes no fucking sense!”
                <br>Heather: “Which one?”
                <br>Seb: “This fucking one, I swear to god I fuckin hate maths!”
                <br>Heather: “Alright alright relax, chill out. Let me see”
                <br>Seb: “Don’t tell me what to fuckin do...”
                <br>
                <br>Seb shows his work to Heather as she grabs it from him without asking.
                <br>
                <br>Seb: “HEY!”

                <br>Eddie, quickly getting bored waiting outside. decides to bust into the classroom.
                <br>Seb nearly jumps out of his chair as he accidentally breaks his pencil.
                <br>
                <br>Seb: “JESUS CHRIST!”
                <br>

                <br>Seb: “I don’t give a single shit.”

                <br>Seb gets up from his desk as he walks out being curious on what’s the commotion about, as he walks
                down the stairs he can hear school lockers being slammed as tons of students crowd around the action.
                One of them being Luke.
                <br>
                <br>Seb: “What the hell is happening now?”

                <br>Luke is a lazy and chilled out person. He played for a football team for his local school in
                New York, then out of no fucking where he got injured that made him rethink his choices. He later
                decided to apply for N.Y. Hero Academy to try to discover more about his power and use it for more.
                <br>
                <br>They stare at the two about to brawl it out as most students just watch around, some even pulling
                out their phones to record.
                <br>
                <br>Dennis: “C'mon pal, whatcha gonna do.”
                <br>
                <br>Dennis grinning with no fear, Kia. screaming from rage. quickly throws a punch towards Dennises face
                without hesitation, Dennis leans backwards barely dodging the punch as Kias fist hits the locker.
                <br>
                <br>Kia: “FUCK”

                <br>Kia Crossfield currently aims to become a Mechanical Hero. Kia is a big fucking nerd when it comes to machinery and tech, his parents being sucessfull business folks. later moved to USA. Oh yeah he's from Sweden I almost forgot.
                <br>
                <br>Dennis quickly grabs his fist as he slowly twists it, Kia starts to scream causing his electric
                power to activate. Slowly tasing Dennis as he quickly let go.
                <br>Dennis gets infuriated as his eyes start to glow red, most of the people gathered around standed
                back in fear. Sebastian without hesitation runs in right before Dennis starts lasering Kia, luckily only
                giving him a burn mark on his hand. While Kia screamed in pain, Sebastian pushed Dennis to the ground
                hitting his head against a locker. Seb tried to say something, but just stared down at him in
                frustration. Dennis slowly gets up as he clenches his fists, quickly giving Sebastian a punch in the
                stomach. Sebastian at first holds his stomach, not long after that he quickly headlocks Dennis as his
                eyes start to glow again. Before Dennis could laser again, Teacher Mr. Krasinski quickly moves in.
                angrily pushing through the crowd.
                <br>
                <br>Mr. Krasinski: “THATS ENOUGH!”
                <br>
                <br>Mr. Krasinski moves his hands out in front to use his Telekinesis to move them away from each other.
                <br>
                <br>Mr. Krasinski: “Two of you, to the principal’s office. Now.”
                <br>
                <br>Sebastian angrily walks away instantly to the principal's office while Dennis stands still for a few
                seconds, staring at Sebastian in pure anger.
                <br>
                <br>Mr. Krasinski: “Hurry up! The office isn’t gonna come over to you.”
                <br>Dennis: “...Bitch..”

                <br><b>LIM CAFE - 4:40PM</b>
                <br>
                <br>After a long road trip, the gang finally arrive at a cafe in New York. Lim Cafe, who is owned by her
                brother. Lim Sung-rok (Or Rok for short). Ronny parks the RV with no door in the alleyway next to the
                cafe, the gang hops out as Ara tells them to wait at the back while she goes in to get keys. The three
                stand in front of the basement entrance while they stare at it.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “What are fuck we gonna do…”
                <br>Edan: “No idea, just wait it out I guess.”
                <br>Jon: “And how long is that gonna be.”
                <br>
                <br>Moments of silence.
                <br>
                <br>Ronny: “Why was he even looking for you?”
                <br>Jon: “How the fuck would I know…”
                <br>
                <br>The three stare down with the awkward silence lasting longer than it should, until Nara finally
                comes back with the basement keys.
                <br>
                <br>Nara: “Alright, he says we can stay for as long as we need to.”
                <br>Edan: “Oh shit nice!”
                <br>
                <br>Nara unlocks the basement door as they all walk into the erry and greenish room, stained walls and
                nearly ripped off posters of superheroes. One couch, a barely cleaned kitchen with a table and few
                chairs, one of the chairs back teared off. A surprisingly big flat-screen tv and three other doors, Two
                of them lead into bedrooms, one for one and the other for two. While the last door leads into the
                bathroom, which is cleaner than the kitchen. Making it the cleanest room in the basement.
                <br>
                <br>Nara: “Huh, could be worse.”
                <br>Ronny: “There’s only three beds though”
                <br>.
                <br>.
                <br>.
                <br>Edan: “Dibs!”
                <br>Nara: “Dibs!”
                <br>Ronny: “Dibs!”
                <br>Jon: “Dib- Fuck!”
                <br>
                <br>The gang spread out as they looked around the basement to get to know the place better.
                <br>
                <br>Ronny: “So, what are we going to do while we're staying here?”
                <br>Nara: “Oh yeah, everyone sit down. Mamas got a plan.”
                <br>
                <br>The gang each grab a chair and sit at the table.

                <br>Edan: “Anyways! what’s the plan?”
                <br>Nara: “Long story short, while we were in the RV. I've been thinking about some personal stuff, but
                not just my own. But all of yours.”
                <br>Jon: “Wha?”
                <br>Nara: “You guys have said that superheroes have fucked you over somehow, but you never actually tell
                them. But I've been thinking, maybe we could use this as an opportunity to finally talk about it. And
                maybe even fight it”
                <br>.
                <br>.
                <br>Jon: “What you mean by that?”
                <br>Nara: “You know what I mean.”
                <br>Jon: “Literally fight back? how the fuck are we suppose to do that?”
                <br>Nara: “I have a plan up my sleeve, just need to find people, that's all. But before I explain my
                plan, I wanna know how heroes have affected you.”
                <br>Ronny: “Have we never talked about this?”
                <br>Edan: “We actually haven’t, besides Jon. We already know his.”
                <br>Jon: “What you mean?”
                <br>Edan: “You told us how you got declined into N.Y. Hero Academy.”
                <br>Jon: “I mean, I suppose. But that’s more like school stuff rather than hero stuff”
                <br>Edan: “You literally wanted to go because you even said to me that you wanted to become a backup
                hero.”
                <br>Jon: “Oh yeeaahhh…”
                <br>
                <br>Nara: “Well, anyway. Which one of you two wants to go first.”
                <br>.
                <br>.
                <br>.
                <br>Edan: “Well me being the more confident one, I was-”
                <br>Ronny: “I was only five years old when It happened.”
                <br>Edan: “You bitch!”
                <br>Ronny: “I remember I was laying down in my bed at the time, it was probably somewhere around 11pm.
                My mother was out drinking with her friends while my father was in his bedroom, it was mostly quiet so
                it wasn’t hard to fall asleep. But I just couldn’t, he was crying. As much as I wanted to come in and
                help him, I-I didn’t know how. So i just hoped he would stop, after around 10 minutes he eventually
                stopped. I remember feeling relieved and glad, after everything went back to being quiet. I closed my
                eyes, not knowing. It was the last thing I was ever going to hear from him. Then it went off, I
                immediately jumped and ran into his bedroom. It was everywhere on the bed. Everywhere..”
                <br>.
                <br>Jon: “What was everywhere?”
                <br>.
                <br>.
                <br>.
                <br>.

                <br>The three stare in disbelief as they stare at Ronny slowly tearing up while spilling out all his
                guts.
                <br>
                <br>“I remember I kept on crying out dad, dad, dad. Please come back... I remember even shaking him, for
                some reason thinking I could wake him up... His face…... It wasn’t there anymore....”
                <br>.
                <br>Edan: “I’m sorry to butt in, but what does this have to do with heroes?”
                <br>.
                <br>Ronny: “I’m getting to it now you fucking dickhead. Fews years later after it all happened, I
                remember asking my mother the reason behind it. At first it was hard for her to get the words out, but
                after a bit she soon told me all of it. She said he was a student at a hero-school, he even graduated
                and applied to become a hero. While he waited and waited, he was working at an office job in the
                meantime. He waited a whole year, just to get a response. They said his power was “too common” and they
                even had the guts to say “We need something more unique” and more fucking bullcrap. And to this day, I
                still want to beat the living shit out of those smugfucks in the face for what they did….”
                <br>
                <br>Nara: “Well, now is our chance. You in?”
                <br>
                <br>Ronny stares down at the table as he sighs to himself in regret.
                <br>
                <br>Ronny: “Fine.. What else have I got.”
                <br>
                <br>Nara: “Jon?”
                <br>Jon: “I suppose.”
                <br>Nara: “Edan?”
                <br>Edan: “Well first, what’s the plan?”
                <br>Nara: “It’s not as complicated as it is, most hero schools require an id in order to get in. so we
                simply have to find someone that makes fake IDs, once we get in. one of us will go from the front, and
                make a distraction. Once the teachers are distracted while two others will sneak in from the back with
                masks on. Go to the file cabinet room, and get as many files as you can. Ronny, Jon. you two will be
                sneaking in. I’ll get you guys bags to put them in, Edan. You’ll be the distraction.”
                <br>Edan: “You're asking the guy that turns invisible to make a distraction..”
                <br>Nara: “Fucking fine, Jon. you’ll go in, show up and show your fake id. Then simply walk past the
                metal detectors.”
                <br>Jon: “Metal detectors? The fuck do they need them for?”
                <br>Nara: “For shootings?”
                <br>Jon: “Shootings happen in hero schools?”
                <br>Nara: “More than regular schools.”
                <br>Jon: “Really? Do they like use their lasers powers n shit too shoot children”
                <br>
                <br>The whole gang slowly turn towards Jon in absolute confusion.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “What?”
                <br>Edan: “Shut up?!”
                <br>
                <br>Nara: “Anyways? Jon. Once you get past the entrance, hang around for a bit. Get to know the students
                even while you're at it, but don't forget to use your fake name. Jon and Edan will get prepare-”
                <br>Jon: “What’s my fake name?”
                <br>Nara: “Uhh uhmmmmmmm…….. Danny.”
                <br>Jon: “Fuckin brilliant-”
                <br>Nara: “ANYWAYS, Ronny and Edan will get prepared as you two are gonna sneak in from the back. I’ll get
                you guys masks and bags so don't worry about that, Once you two sneak to the back. I’ll tell Jon to
                bust open the fire alarms, causing the water sprinklers to go off and causing everyone to run out the front. Once
                everyone goes out, you two move in and grab any that seems important, files, documents, equipment,
                anything. You will have probably around 5-10 minutes so be fast, once times up. You two have to get out
                as quick as possible. Run around from the back to the RV, Jon will have to stay behind in the school for
                abit to make things less suspicious. Cause if they see you suddenly walking away, they're gonna assume
                you for being involved. I’ll drive back to you once I dropped off Ronny and Edan here, during that time. Try
                gathering more information, talk to others. Just don’t be an idiot, once I come back. Imma need you to
                do something big for me.”
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “What’s that?”
                <br>.
                <br>.
                <br>.
                <br>Nara: “Vomit.”
                <br>Jon: “What.”
                <br>Nara: “It’s the best excuse and you will look the least suspicious, If you said you need to go out
                of nowhere. It’s gonna look weird, you need to make a good excuse. So I'll need you to get sick so they
                have to send you home, And i’ll pretend to be the friend that you called to pick you up.”
                <br>Ronny: "You guys aren't friends?”
                <br>Nara: “We are, when did I say we’re weren't?”
                <br>Ronny: “You said you were pretending”
                <br>Nara: “Jesus fucking christ, okay. I’ll be the one picking him up okay?”
                <br>Ronny: “Ohhh! okay.”
                <br>Jon: "The fuck?"
                <br>Nara: “So, are you in now?”
                <br>
                <br>Nara furiously stares deep into Edan’s soul.
                <br>
                <br>Edan: “How are we gonna get fake Ids?”
                <br>Nara: “FUCKIN HELL I SAID I’LL FIGURE IT OUT! JUST TELL ME ARE YOU IN OR NO-”
                <br>
                <br>A bunch of empty cans fall over, revealing that Jin was standing in front of the unclosed door the
                whole time.
                <br>
                <br>Rok: “Shit.”
                <br>Jon: “The fuck?”
                <br>Nara: “How long were you there?”
                <br>Rok: “5 minutes.”
                <br>Nara: “Why were you there for 5 minutes?”
                <br>Rok: “I’m not entirely sure, but I heard you guys talking about fake ids. And funny enough, I know
                someone who can make them.”
                <br>Jon: “Really?”
                <br>Edan: “You do?”
                <br>Nara: “How.”
                <br>Rok: “They actually used to be a customer! We would chat alot and we even got along pretty well.
                They told me they can make fake passports, ids, especially driver’s licenses. I even have their phone
                number and I even text them occasionally, If you guys really need some I could get you some. But it will
                cost a bit”
                <br>
                <br>The gang stare at each other in pure excitement with glee.
                <br>
                <br>Nara: “How much!?”
                <br>Rok: “How many do you want?”
                <br>Nara: “I’m thinking 3 would be good enough, mainly for them. Not me”
                <br>Rok: “Oki dokie, gonna cost 310.”
                <br>Nara: “WHAT.”
                <br>Edan: “Fuck that i’ll just use my actual one!”
                <br>Rok: “Do you want to get caught?”
                <br>Edan: “Ugh... fucks sake..”
                <br>
                <br>Edan takes out his naruto wallet and pulls out 70 bucks, slapping it down on the table.
                <br>
                <br>Edan: “That’s all I’ve got.”
                <br>Ronny: “I’ve got 35 bucks, and some chewgum.”
                <br>
                <br>The room goes silent as everyone else in the room stares at Jon.
                <br>
                <br>Jon: “...What?”
                <br>Edan: “How much do you have?”
                <br>Jon: “....Two...”
                <br>Nara: “...Two what….”
                <br>
                <br>Jon: "bucks...."

                <br>Edan currently laying down in one of the bedrooms, smoking a rolled-up joint while gazing out the
                little upper window. while Ronny is past asleep in the other room with a nearly empty whiskey flask on
                the floor, Jon lays down on the couch staring into the ceiling while Nara comes out of bathroom.
                <br>
                <br>Nara: “We’re all gonna lay down now alright?”
                <br>Jon: “Okay.”
                <br>
                <br>Nara notices Jons voice being monotone all of a sudden. Aswell as the depressed look on his face.
                <br>
                <br>Nara: “Hey, you feeling alright?”
                <br>Jon: “Yeah, I'm just. Really exhausted.”
                <br>Nara: “Oh, okay. Well get some rest man. You're gonna need it..”
                <br>Jon: “Aight. night”
                <br>Nara: “Night..”
                <br>
                <br>Nara walks into the same room as Edan as she closes the door behind her. Jon sighs, wondering what
                the fuck has just happened for the past two days.

                <br>Jon: “I’m fine, I'm just… it’s just.
                <br>Julie: “It’s just what?”
                <br>Jon: “I… I’m not sure how to really explain it, but. I’m going to be fine.”
                <br>Julie: “Jon. What happened.”
                <br>Jon: “I-I can’t explain it.”
                <br>Julie “Well get home right now, you had Michelle having a panic attack in the sitting room. Even

                <br>Jon hangs up the call as he quickly turns off his phone, shaking down as his anxiety builds up. He
                rushes to the bathroom as he starts to vomit aggressively into the toilet.

                <br>9 Year old Jon is seen sitting on the school bench as the other kids play around in the schoolyard.
                He’s seen holding a note for someone as he stares at it while feeling melancholy. Jon quickly notices a
                kid in a grey sweatshirt walking over to Jon as he quickly throws the note down behind the bench.
                <br>
                <br>Kev: “You alright?”
                <br>Jon: “Oh, yeah why?.”
                <br>Kev: “You look down, How about we play Heroes n Villains?”

                <br>The two proceed to play Heroes n Villains, Jon and Kev being the heroes and the other kids playing
                the villains. They’re seen having fun as the pink heart-shaped note lays on the ground, falling into a
                puddle as it slowly gets wet.
